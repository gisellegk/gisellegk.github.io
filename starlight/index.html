  <div>What’s one thing you’ve always wanted to do, only you lacked the resources?</div>
</div>

<div id="part-one">

  <div id="side">
    <p>I've wanted to do this project since August. I dreamed of a dress as big as the milky way, mysterious and enigmatic and multifaceted and surprising as the universe we live in. I have a passion for combining artistic and technical creativity, a love for a technical challenge, creating with my hands, and the starry night sky.</p>

  <p>I developed a custom miniature circuit board system, designed to be modular and easy to wire. I optimized for low cost-to-star ratio compared to existing methods with similar individual control over the brightness of each light. </p>
  <p>I hand-soldered every tiny surface mount component and made cables for each 3mm LED out of scrap Ethernet cable, and programmed an algorithm that would twinkle each star in its own unique and subtle pattern.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-three">

</div>
<div class="text"><p>I've wanted to do this project since January, when the FIRST Robotics Competition game came out. This year, the kids had to build a robot that played a space-themed game. It was my 6th and final year serving as a mentor for the team after I graduated high school, as I knew I was moving away for college this summer. </p>
<p>So I volunteered to coach the drive team, and be on the field with them during competitions. The kids decided they all wanted to wear tutus to show spirit (the boys too, if that wasn’t obvious!) so I went along and made the biggest tutu I could manage. Our team color, navy blue on the surface, then purples and cyans, and yellows and oranges, and finally white for the bright hot center of the galaxy. It would have been fun to add lights, but I was on a tight schedule, finalizing college plans and helping the family move out of the house.
</p></div>
<div id="part-four">
  <img id="eight" src="./img/8_.JPG"></img>
  <p>I've wanted to do this project since senior year of high school, when I first learned to sew. I made my prom dress. I wanted a star gown then, so I asked my date to teach me how to make a custom PCB. It didn’t quite work.</p>
  <p>I’ve wanted to do this project ever since each time I made a circuit board with a fatal mistake, for every time that I abandon a project, and for every time I start again despite the risk of disappointment.</p>

</div>

<div id="part-five">
  <img id="seven" src="./img/7.JPG"></img>  <img id="nine" src="./img/9.JPG"></img>
  <p>I’ve wanted to do this project since middle school, when I drew my first space dress design, but didn’t have the skills or resources to make it.</p>
</div>
<div class="text">
     <p>I’ve wanted to do this project ever since I was a small child, the first time I ever picked up a marker and drew something, the first time I ever dreamed of a more fantastical world. </p>
     <p>I might not have known at the time, but every project and every dream I’ve ever had, I was already working on, before I even knew exactly what it was. And (although sometimes it doesn’t feel like it, when I’m struggling through Calculus, or can’t get a lab to work) I’m already working on every ambition I have now or will dream up in the future. Be it landing a dream internship this summer, or perhaps someday being part of the team that builds a telescope that will find a habitable exoplanet in a solar system far away, what I do now builds towards future skills and accomplishments beyond what I can imagine now. </p>
