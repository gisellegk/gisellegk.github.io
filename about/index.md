## About me

Hi, I'm Giselle! I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at CU Boulder. I graduated with an Associate's Degree in Engineering Science from Tunxis Community College in Farmington, CT in 2019, and relocated to Boulder, CO. I hope to work in the aerospace industry someday, helping to further science and space exploration. I like to work on projects relating to robotics, model rocketry, and the intersection of art and engineering. This website is a portfolio of my (mostly) finished works.

I'm also a co-founder of [Let's Build Rockets Inc](http://www.letsbuildrockets.org/), an educational nonprofit that releases open source hardware and software resources on robotics and rocketry.

Back in Connecticut, I mentored the [Farmington FIRST Robotics team](http://www.farmingtonrobotics.org/) for many years! Now that I've moved westwards, my new home team is [Inov8](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/7891/) out of Longmont.
