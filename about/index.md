## About me

Hi, I'm Giselle!
I graduated with my BS in Electrical Engineering from CU Boulder in 2023. I followed a non-traditional educational path, learning largely through self-directed projects before traditional education was accessible to me. 

I hope to work in the aerospace industry someday, helping to further science and space exploration. I like to work on projects relating to robotics, model rocketry, and the intersection of art and engineering. This website is a portfolio of my (mostly) finished works.

Back in Connecticut, I mentored the [Farmington FIRST Robotics team](http://www.farmingtonrobotics.org/) for many years!
