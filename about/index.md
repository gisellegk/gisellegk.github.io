## About me

Hi, I'm Giselle! I like to make things. I'm an Engineering Science student at Tunxis Community College. I focus on projects relating to robotics, web development, and the intersection of art and engineering. This website is a portfolio of my (mostly) finished works.

When I'm not working on one of my many projects, you might find me mentoring the [Farmington FIRST Robotics team](http://www.farmingtonrobotics.org/) or taking care of the birds at the [Roaring Brook Nature Center](http://www.roaringbrook.org/).

I'm also a co-founder of [Let's Build Rockets Inc](http://www.letsbuildrockets.org/), an educational nonprofit that releases open source hardware and software resources on robotics and rocketry.
