Among so many other things, we want to make a robot for the [Trinity College International Robot Contest](http://www.trincoll.edu/events/robot/).

We might be able to get funding from someone from IEEE, so we are hoping to make the coolest, most over-the-top robot we can come up with.

I wanted to have the robot use swerve drive. It has always been really cool to see it implemented in FRC robots I saw in high school. I'd never gotten the chance to design anything while in FRC, so I want to take this chance to do it myself.
