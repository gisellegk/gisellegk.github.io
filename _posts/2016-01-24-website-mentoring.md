We're snowed in here in CT, though not quite as much as what they've got around the DC area. A bunch of us got together on Google Hangouts to set up their systems so that they can contribute to [the team's website](http://www.farmingtonrobotics.org). 

I went ahead and downloaded this slick looking new text editor, [Atom](https://atom.io). And yet, here I am, still using Sublime, lol. I'll switch over eventually. But we also installed git and set it up so that they can use Jekyll to preview local changes.

We started them off with some basic tasks (create a new page, add content to that page). Hopefully we'll be able to push on to more complicated tasks. It'd probably be best to encourage them to choose what *they* want to see on the website, so that it's more fun.
