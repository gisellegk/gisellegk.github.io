Some links I found that I might use for my Celestarium Star Chart.
[International Astronomical Union Constellation Reference](http://www.iau.org/public/themes/constellations/)

[RASC Calgary Centre - Mega Star Chart Files](http://calgary.rasc.ca/starcharts/index.htm)

[Also my local copy of the knitting pattern.](file:///home/giselle/Downloads/celestarium_030613.pdf) You can purchase your own [here](www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/celestarium).
