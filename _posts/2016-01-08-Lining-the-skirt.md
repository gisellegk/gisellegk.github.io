I replaced the lining on my skirt. I'm thinking of revisiting the idea of having tulle in the back of the skirt to suggest nebulae. I also chalked out places where the LEDs and WS2811's could be sewn. 

Gemma - 9 mA
LEDs - 20 mA (please power from battery 5v not gemma's 3.3v)

15 WS2811 x 3 leds = 45 (lining)
? WS2811 x 3 leds = ? (tulle)
