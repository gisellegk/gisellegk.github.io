I'm currently hashing out the structure of the website! As you can see, the home page is now just links to the project pages. I made projects a [Jekyll Collection](http://ben.balter.com/2015/02/20/jekyll-collections/), which is a feature that's new to me.I've also added a bunch of post stubs that will be updated.

The website will be oriented around the projects. Each project page will have information about the project, files, and a "news feed" of recent updates relating to the project. If you go to [/blog](/blog), you will be able to view the site as a traditional chronological blog. 

I haven't decided how I'm going to do this yet, but I'd also like a "hatchery" or "sandbox" of some sort for ideas I'm thinking of pursuing but haven't done anything substantial on yet.
