title: Mini Test Bot motors!
---
So we finished wiring the mini test bot's two motors. We plan on making the base interchangeable, so our first base is a simple tank drive with two motors and encoders.

 There is space for four victors on the electrical board, though we've only mounted 2 of them. We are using a DB25 connector between the main part and base with a bunch of pins disconnected right now but in the future we can connect up to two more motors and encoders.

 I wrote some simple software to test the motors using an arduino rather than a roboRIO.
