I need a place to track and show off all the cool stuff I've been working on, and here it is. 

It's clearly still under construction, but I'm happy to start it!

My goal is to design the site to function like a blog, but rather than the chronological post paradigm typical of blogs, it will be centered around projects, with posts serving to record progress / report updates to each one. I also want to have some Ravelry-inspired functions, such as percentage of completion and date started/finished.

My first project, naturally, will be this website :) I'll be posting with a lot of ongoing projects too!
