Today is kickoff for FRC! The name of the game this year is FIRST Stronghold! Of course, we already knew that, because the teaser was released like last September or something.

Anyways, I saw the game described on Facebook as "Breakaway on drugs" -- three-sectioned field with barriers separating each (these ones are way crazier than 2010's), end game is hanging on a tower, and you score with balls (boulders this time, rather than soccer balls).

It's really complicated but I think it's an awesome game!
