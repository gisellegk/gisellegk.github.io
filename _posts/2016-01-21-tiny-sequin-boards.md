Created some tiny boards. They are cheap to order from OSH Park, so I got a few to test with!

I think they are pretty awesome. I hope they aren't too difficult to sew with...

I also started planning how I will attach the Gemma to the skirt. I ordered some tiny size 5/0 metal snaps. Hopefully they are small enough so that I don't short anything out.
