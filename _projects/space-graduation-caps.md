## About
The original series of space themed graduation caps. 

The first one was mine, a painting of the swan nebula. Circa 2013. 

The other two are my friends' caps, when they graduated in 2015. One of them features white LED stars and a custom PCB with a microcontroller, to randomly fade/twinkle the stars. This was one of my first PCB / electronics projects.
