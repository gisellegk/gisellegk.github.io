## About

Holiday Lights is a Mini Christmas Tree with individually addressable LED lights. Completed for and used in the Silas Deane Middle School Hour of Code week in December 2015.

The light strings are made up of WS2811 LEDs, assembled by students from the Second Law Enforcers, a FIRST Robotics team from Farmington High School.
