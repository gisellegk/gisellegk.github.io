## About
A crochet amigurumi (stuffed animal) likeness of Stormfly, a dragon from the How To Train Your Dragon movie series.

Created for a friend as a gift for one of her friends, Stormfly was the first amigurumi I created with this degree of complexity and without a pattern. She is made only from yarn and stuffing, and all shaping was done by varying increases and decreases in the stitches.
