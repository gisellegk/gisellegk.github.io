## About
The objective of this project was to design and build a working grating spectrograph that operates in the visible light spectrum. The spectrograph is designed to measure the spectrum of emission-line light sources such as gas discharge lamps.
This project was completed as the course project for ASTR 3560 - Astronomical Instrumentation. I worked in a team of four students, called F-EOS, to complete this project. We were the first team in the history of the class to be able to produce a spectrum from our instrument.
