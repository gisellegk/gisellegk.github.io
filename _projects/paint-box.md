## About
A graduation present for my best friend, who earned her Bachelor's in Economics at the University of Chicago in 2017.

Eric and I made a wooden box for some store-bought iridescent paints. We used leftover pieces of red oak from another project, and stained it a dark chocolate brown. The slots for the paints and paintbrush were milled out on a Bridgeport milling machine. There are neodymium magnets under the brass corner plates, to keep the box closed when not in use.

We etched a nameplate from brass sheet with ferric chloride, using similar resist techniques as in DIY PCB etching. Soaking it in vinegar and then lightly sanding the raised surfaces gave it an antiqued finish.
