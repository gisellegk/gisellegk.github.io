## About
Built during the [WiCHacks 2017](http://wichacks.rit.edu/) MLH hackathon, Light Code is a modular electronics project designed to encourage people of all ages to learn how to code. Despite being a fun project for anyone, Team Light Code took into consideration the needs of our younger audience to create an interface that is accessible and appealing to those with less developed reading and writing skills.

Light Code was featured at the MLH Office Gallery as a part of their Hack on Loan program.

## Awards
- Best UI by New Relic
- Best Hardware Hack by Liberty Mutual
