## About

Created in 2014, the Digital Sign In Sheet is a simple attendance solution for non-classroom school environments. Students at Silas Deane Middle School are able to scan a barcode on their ID badges in order to "check in" to various rooms such as the library, computer lab, and office. It replaced the excel spreadsheets and handwritten sign in sheets used in the building.

There are two flavors of sign-in, one that records their entry time and exit time ("Sign In"), and a simpler one that only records an entry time ("Badge Scanner").
