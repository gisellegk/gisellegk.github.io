## About
I was the project lead for the Let's Build Rockets website. I worked on back- and front-end development of new website using the Jekyll static site generator and GitHub pages.

I managed the transition to the new design and continue to maintain and improve the website with the help of our interns.

The code is open-source and available to view on GitHub.
